# UNICARE BiH Inform-Primero Integration

Workflow to integrate UNICEF's data collection tool Inform (built on Ona) with UNICARE (an implementation of Primero used for grievance and feedback reporting and follow-up case management) for Bosnia and Herzegovina ("BiH"). Note that they also might want to implement this same workflow for Turkey. 

## About UNICARE
UNICEF has started the development of the UNICARE project, a corporate digital solution for Complaints, Feedback, and Response Mechanisms (CFRMs) across UNICEF offices and partner organizations. This initiative, a collaboration of the EMOPS, ICTD, DAPM, Safeguarding and CSS teams, will result in innovative digital solutions and foster partnerships with key stakeholders to strengthen community engagement and accountability.
